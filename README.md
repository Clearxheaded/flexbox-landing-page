For this project I will be building an entire web page using HTML/CSS.

This project helped me refine my skills in both HTML and CSS, especially in the use of Flexbox for layout management. I aimed for a simple yet effective design that prioritizes user experience, with a focus on ensuring that the content adapts to different screen sizes.
